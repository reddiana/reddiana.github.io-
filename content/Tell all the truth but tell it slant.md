> Tell all the truth but tell it slant

> Tell all the truth but tell it slant,
> Success in Circuit lies,
> Too bright for our infirm Delight
> The Truth's superb surprise; 
> 
> As Lightning to the Children eased 
> With explanation kind, 
> The Truth must dazzle gradually
> Or every man be blind.
